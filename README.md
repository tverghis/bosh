## Rules:

- The Universe is an infinite two-dimensional grid.
- Each cell can be in two states: Alive or Dead.
- Each cell has eight neighbors.
- An Alive cell with fewer than two neighbors dies in the next generation.
- An Alive cell with greater than three neighbors dies in the next generation.
- A Dead cell with exactly three neighbors becomes Alive in the next generation.
